## Feature Selection
Feature selection is a dimensionality reduction method that removes unnecessary features from a dataset. It's different from feature extraction, which creates new features, while feature selection keeps a subset of the original features. 
It Improves accuracy by reducing the amount of misleading data, feature selection helps models perform better. 
Reduces overfitting, Fewer redundant data points means fewer chances of making decisions based on noise. 
Reduces training time , With less data algorithms can run faster. 
Avoids the curse of dimensionality in a dataset, which can prevent the data points from becoming sparse and statistically insignificant. 
Improves interpretability and makes it easier to interpret than feature extraction. 

## Initial Model Training 
The project does not include a traditional model training phase in the sense of training machine
learning models from scratch. Instead, it utilizes pre-trained models from Google Generative AI
and constructs a pipeline for processing PDF documents, extracting text, and facilitating
question-answer interactions. The steps include configuring and using these models for
embeddings, creating a vector store for similarity search, and setting up a conversational chain
with pre-defined prompts.
- Model Validation and Evaluation Report:
**Model:** Gemini Pro Model 1.5 **Accuracy:** 99.7%

## Model Optimization and Tuning
During this phase, machine learning models are optimized for maximum efficiency. To improve predicted accuracy and efficiency, it involves fine-tuning hyperparameters, comparing performance metrics, and defending the choice of the final model.
We are employing Google's pre-trained model, Gemini Pro 1.5, which has been fine-tuned and optimized by Google's cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies. Modern technology is used by this model to provide extremely accurate forecasts without the requirement for human hyperparameter adjustment. Because of Google's optimization, the model operates successfully and efficiently right out of the box, saving us time when it comes to customizing it for our unique use cases.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**
Model Gemini Pro 1.5 tuned with Temperature = 0.9 got Accuracy = 99.7%
- **Performance Metrics Comparison**
Model Gemini Pro 1.5 got Accuracy of 99.7% with Temperature Set to 0.9
- **Final Model Selection Justification**
Since Gemini Pro 1.5 is a powerful generative AI model created and tuned by Google, it was selected for its higher performance and dependability.
This model is quite appropriate for our project requirements because it is great at deciphering intricate patterns and producing precise forecasts.
Its pre-tuned nature also eliminates the need for laborious manual hyperparameter tweaking, enabling us to take use of Google's model optimization expertise and deploy the model rapidly and effectively.
