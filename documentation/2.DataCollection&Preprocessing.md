## Data Exploration and Preprocessing 
Template Identifies data sources, assesses quality issues like missing values and duplicates, and
implements resolution plans to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.

- **Data Overview Section**
1. Data Sources: The dataset includes multilingual
documents collected from different online repositories,
academic databases, and organizational records.
2. Basic Statistics: Total Number of Documents: 50,000, Languages Covered: English, Spanish, French,
German, Chinese, Arabic. File Formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT
3. Dimensions: Number of Records: 50 000 documents, Attributes: Document ID: a unique identifier of
the document, Language: Language to which the document belongs, Content: the proper text part of any
document, Metadata, Author, Date, etc.
4. Structure: Document ID: A unique identifier for each
document, Language: Language to which the document
belongs, Content: This is the proper text part of any
document
- **Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**
1. Language Distribution) English: 30%, Spanish: 20%, French: 15%, German: 15%, Chinese: 10%, Arabic: 10%
2. Content Length) Mean: 1.500 words | Median: 1.200 words | Mode: 1,000 words
3. Metadata Analysis) Authors: Most frequent authors, average number of
documents per author. Publication Dates: Distribution of documents over time.
4. Scatter Plot) Content length distribution for various
languages, Correlation Analysis: Language of documents and their
publication date. Trend Analysis: Document length over time.
Multivariate Analysis
5. Language, Content Length and Publication Date: 3D Scatter Plot: Interaction between language, word
count, and date.
6. Clustering Analysis: K-Means Clustering: Documents clustered by language,
word count, and metadata.
7. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by Dimensionality Reduction that involves identifying major
components that capture maximum variance within the dataset.

- **Outliers and Anomalies**
1. Identification of Outliers) Z-Score Method: Identify documents with an extreme
length of content. IQR Method: To identify outliers in metadata attributes
such as publication dates.
2. Treatment of Outliers) Content Length: Trim or transform extreme
values. Metadata Anomalies: Records having incorrect/suspicious metadata are corrected or removed.
3. Missing Values) Detection: Recognition of missing values from
document content and metadata. Resolution by Imputation: The missing values would be filled with the
mean/median/mode. Resoloution by Filtering: A lot of records having large missing data are
removed.
4. Duplicates) Detection: The duplicate documents are detected by
similarity of contents. Resolution: The duplicate records are removed to assure
accuracy of the data.

## Data Quality Report
**Overview:** The Data Quality Report summarizes data quality issues
from the document extraction process, including severity levels and
resolution plans. It aims to systematically identify and rectify data
discrepancies, ensuring high accuracy and efficiency in data extraction
from multilingual documents.

- **Data Source | Data Quality Issue | Severity | Resolution Plan**
- Extracted Invoices Dataset | Missing text in specific fields due to OCR limitations | High | Enhance OCR model accuracy by training on a diverse dataset, and implement post-OCR validation checks.
- Extracted Legal Documents Dataset | Misclassification of document types | Moderate | Improve the classification algorithm byincorporating additional features and refining the training data.
- Extracted Financial Statements Dataset |Inconsistent numerical data formats | Low | Standardize numerical data formats using
data preprocessing scripts before analysis.
- Extracted Medical Records Dataset | Incorrect language detection for multilingual documents | High | Integrate advanced language detection
algorithms and cross-validate with known language segments.
- Extracted Business Reports Dataset |Duplicate data
entries due to repeated scans | Moderate | Implement deduplication techniques to identify and merge duplicate entries based on unique identifiers.
- Extracted Receipts Dataset |Outliers in
numerical data due to scanning artifacts | Moderate | Apply statistical methods to detect and correct outliers, such as z-score analysis or the IQR method.
- Extracted Surveys Dataset | Missing responses
in survey data | High | Use imputation techniques to fill missing
responses, and ensure completeness by
prompting users for mandatory fields during survey collection.
