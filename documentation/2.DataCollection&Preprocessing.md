#Data Exploration and Preprocessing 
Template Identifies data sources, assesses quality issues like missing values and duplicates, and
implements resolution plans to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.

- **Data Overview Section**
1. Data Sources: The dataset includes multilingual
documents collected from different online repositories,
academic databases, and organizational records.
2. Basic Statistics: Total Number of Documents: 50,000, Languages Covered: English, Spanish, French,
German, Chinese, Arabic. File Formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT
3. Dimensions: Number of Records: 50 000 documents, Attributes: Document ID: a unique identifier of
the document, Language: Language to which the document belongs, Content: the proper text part of any
document, Metadata, Author, Date, etc.
4. Structure: Document ID: A unique identifier for each
document, Language: Language to which the document
belongs, Content: This is the proper text part of any
document
- **Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**
1. Language Distribution) English: 30%, Spanish: 20%, French: 15%, German: 15%, Chinese: 10%, Arabic: 10%
2. Content Length) Mean: 1.500 words | Median: 1.200 words | Mode: 1,000 words
3. Metadata Analysis) Authors: Most frequent authors, average number of
documents per author. Publication Dates: Distribution of documents over time.
4. Scatter Plot) Content length distribution for various
languages, Correlation Analysis: Language of documents and their
publication date. Trend Analysis: Document length over time.
Multivariate Analysis
5. Language, Content Length and Publication Date: 3D Scatter Plot: Interaction between language, word
count, and date.
6. Clustering Analysis: K-Means Clustering: Documents clustered by language,
word count, and metadata.
7. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by Dimensionality Reduction that involves identifying major
components that capture maximum variance within the dataset.

- **Outliers and Anomalies**
1. Identification of Outliers) Z-Score Method: Identify documents with an extreme
length of content. IQR Method: To identify outliers in metadata attributes
such as publication dates.
2. Treatment of Outliers) Content Length: Trim or transform extreme
values. Metadata Anomalies: Records having incorrect/suspicious metadata are corrected or removed.
3. Missing Values) Detection: Recognition of missing values from
document content and metadata. Resolution by Imputation: The missing values would be filled with the
mean/median/mode. Resoloution by Filtering: A lot of records having large missing data are
removed.
4. Duplicates) Detection: The duplicate documents are detected by
similarity of contents. Resolution: The duplicate records are removed to assure
accuracy of the data.
